# CSCI5308

This is a Java application that simulates Ice Hockey. It is specific to the national hockey league but is flexible enough for other leagues.

It contains features such as:

Creating and managing teams in any conference.
Simulating multiple seasons.
Trading players between teams.
Aging and retiring players.
Game simulation.
Trophy system.
This is part of a group project from course CSCI 5308 - MACS Dalhousie.

We used SOLID principles, necessary design patterns, and followed coding standards.
